    John Clayton Mayer (/ˈmeɪ.ər/;[1] born October 16, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist and producer.[2] He was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and raised in
    nearby Fairfield. He attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, but disenrolled and moved to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1997 with Clay Cook. Together, they formed
    short-lived, two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubs—refining his skills and gaining a following. After his appearance at
    the 2001 South by Southwest Festival, he was signed to Aware Records, and then Columbia Records, which released his first EP, Inside Wants Out. His following two full-length
    albums—Room for Squares (2001) and Heavier Things (2003)—did well commercially, achieving multi-platinum status. In 2003, he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal
    Performance for the single "Your Body Is a Wonderland".
